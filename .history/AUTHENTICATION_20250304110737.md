# Azure Authentication for Terraform

This project uses Azure CLI authentication for Terraform, which simplifies the authentication process and avoids the need to manage service principal credentials.

## Authentication Methods

### Azure CLI Authentication (Current Method)

The simplest and most secure way to authenticate:

1. Log in to Azure CLI:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

2. Terraform will automatically use your Azure CLI credentials when running commands:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

### Service Principal Authentication (Alternative)

If you need to use a service principal (for CI/CD or automation):

1. Create a service principal:
   ```bash
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "terraform_service_principal" --role="Owner" --scopes="/subscriptions/YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
   ```

2. Set environment variables with the credentials:
   ```bash
   export ARM_CLIENT_ID="SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_APP_ID"
   export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD"
   export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
   export ARM_TENANT_ID="YOUR_TENANT_ID"
   ```

3. Update the provider.tf file by commenting out the CLI authentication and uncommenting the service principal section.

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit credentials to version control
- Use managed identities when running Terraform from Azure
- Rotate service principal credentials regularly
- Use minimum required permissions for service principals
